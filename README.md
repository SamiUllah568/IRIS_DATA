# IRIS_DATA
Worked extensively with the Iris dataset, a widely-used dataset in machine learning and statistics, containing 150 samples of iris flowers with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). Leveraged this dataset for classification tasks to predict the species of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) using machine learning algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. Applied data visualization techniques to understand feature relationships and improve model accuracy.
